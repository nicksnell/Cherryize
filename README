Cherryize
=========

Cherryize is simple wrapper around the CherryPy WSGI server. It can be used to run WSGI 
compatible applications such as Django, Pylons etc...

It is essentially a fork of Django Cerise Project:

http://xhtml.net/scripts/Django-CherryPy-server-DjangoCerise

Which has a similar purpose, this is intended to be slightly easier to use & configure 
and to work with other WSGI applications - not just Django
