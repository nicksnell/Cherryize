Cherryize
=========

Cherryize is simple wrapper around the CherryPy WSGI server. It can be used to run WSGI 
compatible applications such as Django, Pylons etc...

It is essentially a fork of Django Cerise Project:

http://xhtml.net/scripts/Django-CherryPy-server-DjangoCerise

(and indeed much of the credit should go here)

Which has a similar purpose, this is intended to be slightly easier to use & configure 
(only have one config file) and to work with other WSGI applications - not just Django

Usage
-----

1. Create a configuration file in your project (the project root is probably the best 
place) - see the sample config below for options.

2. Call "cherryize /path/to/conf" or "cherryize --conf=/path/to/conf" to start the 
server. Depending on your settings this will either print the PID and return (in the
case of daemon mode) or will to continue to run until manually terminated.
